# 🚀 Deploy Your App to Cloudflare (Super Simple Guide)

## What You Need First
- A Cloudflare account (free at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com))
- Your terminal open in the project folder

## Step 1: Login to Cloudflare 🔑
```bash
npm run cf:login
```
- This opens your web browser
- Click "Allow" when it asks
- You're now logged in!

## Step 2: Create Storage Space 📦
```bash
npm run cf:kv:create
```
- This creates a place to store your data
- Copy the ID it gives you (looks like: `abc123def456`)

## Step 3: Update Config File ⚙️
Open `wrangler.toml` and replace this line:
```
id = "REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_ACTUAL_KV_ID"
```
With your actual ID:
```
id = "abc123def456"
```

## Step 4: Build Your App 🔨
```bash
npm run build
```
- This prepares your app for the internet
- Wait for it to finish

## Step 5: Deploy! 🚀
```bash
npm run cf:deploy
```
- This puts your app on the internet
- You'll get a URL like: `https://salesforce-data-cleaner.pages.dev`

## That's It! 🎉
Your app is now live on the internet! Anyone can use it at your URL.

## If Something Goes Wrong 😅

### "Not logged in" error:
```bash
npm run cf:login
```

### "KV namespace not found":
```bash
npm run cf:kv:create
```
Then update the ID in `wrangler.toml`

### "Build failed":
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Check if it worked:
```bash
npm run cf:whoami
```
This shows if you're logged in
