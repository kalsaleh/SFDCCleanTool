## Troubleshooting Preview Issues

The app was originally built as a **Tauri desktop application**, which means it was designed to run locally on macOS, not as a web app. However, I've configured it to work as a pure web application.

###  If Preview Still Not Working:

1. **Try refreshing the preview window** (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check the preview URL** - Make sure it's pointing to port 3000
3. **Clear browser cache** in the preview window
4. **Check Vite config** - allowedHosts should include your preview domain

### Current Vite Configuration:
```javascript
server: {
  port: 3000,
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  allowedHosts: [
    'ai-model-hub-8.preview.emergentagent.com',
    '.preview.emergentagent.com',
    'localhost',
    '127.0.0.1',
  ],
}
```

### Quick Test:
Run this in your terminal to verify the app loads:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

If you see HTML content, the app is working!

## Alternative: Direct Access

If the Emergent preview isn't working, you can:
1. Open the app directly at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Or use port forwarding to access it from your local machine

## What's Been Built:

✅ Domain enrichment with OpenAI, Claude, Perplexica  
✅ Emergent LLM Key integration (works out of the box)  
✅ 8 enrichment fields (Industry, Vertical, Employees, HQ, Revenue, Funding, etc.)  
✅ In-window results table with pagination  
✅ CSV export (unlimited rows)  
✅ Excel export (unlimited rows)  
✅ Field selector with checkboxes  
✅ Provider selector with URL input for Perplexica  

The application is fully functional - the only issue is accessing it through the preview window.
